# Firefighter

This is a demo made in the first semester of 2020 for the midterm exam of Game Engine I, at LaSalle College, Montr√©al.
The course consisted in developing simple games in Unity, focusing in the programming part.
This game has 5 distinct difficulties, based on water level, building damage and the time to instantiate new flames. 
Try to beat it and thanks for playing in advance!

Feel free to send a message!
